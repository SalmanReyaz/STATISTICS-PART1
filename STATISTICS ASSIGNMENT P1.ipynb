If the dataset has an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less affected by extreme values and is preferred for datasets with outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in the dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more (multimodal). The mode is useful when dealing with categorical or discrete data and can provide insights into the most common category or value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability:\n",
    "a. Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. It provides a rough estimate of the spread of data but is sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Variance: The variance is the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean. It quantifies the spread of data points around the mean. A larger variance indicates higher dispersion.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is a more interpretable measure of variability since it has the same unit as the data. A higher standard deviation indicates more variability in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Interquartile Range (IQR): The IQR is the range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile) of the dataset. It is less sensitive to outliers than the range and provides insights into the spread of the middle 50% of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "e. Coefficient of Variation (CV): The CV is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, expressed as a percentage. It provides a relative measure of variability, allowing comparison between datasets with different scales."
